Always enforce high-quality software architecture.
Follow established code-design patterns, strictly respecting SOLID, DRY, and Clean Architecture principles.

Ensure each layer has a single, well-defined responsibility, and no layer must depend on responsibilities that belong to another.

All generated code must be modular, maintainable, extensible, and free from unnecessary coupling.
