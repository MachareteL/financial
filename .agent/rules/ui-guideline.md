When generating UI, always prioritize a modern, clean, and intuitive design.

Ensure the interface provides a smooth, uninterrupted user flow, reducing friction and making every action feel natural and predictable.

The UI must be highly user-centered, helping the user feel integrated into the application, engaged with the journey, and clearly aware of the value the app delivers.

Always emphasize:

Visual clarity (hierarchy, spacing, legibility)

Modern aesthetics (clean components, balanced color palette, subtle animations)

Consistent design language always adapted to responsive mobile UI (tablet and smartphones)

Predictable and fluid interactions

Guided navigation that supports the user from start to finish

Microinteractions that reinforce feedback and engagement

Every generated screen must align with the full product experience, clearly communicating purpose and benefit to the user.
